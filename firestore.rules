/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-specific data, such as orders and recommendations, is
 * stored in subcollections under that user's unique document. This ensures that users can only ever access their own information.
 * Public data, like the product catalog, is readable by everyone but writable only by administrators (a role not yet defined, so writes are currently disabled).
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into two main top-level collections: `/products` for public catalog information and `/users` for
 * all user-related data. Each user document at `/users/{userId}` acts as a root for their private subcollections, including `/orders` and `/recommendations`.
 * This hierarchical structure simplifies security by tying access control directly to the document path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict User Data Privacy: All paths under `/users/{userId}` are only accessible to the authenticated user whose UID matches `{userId}`.
 * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy, it is impossible to list all documents in the `/users` collection.
 * - Public Product Catalog: The `/products` collection is world-readable, allowing any client (authenticated or not) to browse items.
 * - Admin-Only Product Management: Writes to the `/products` collection are disabled by default, awaiting the implementation of an admin role system. This ensures a secure-by-default posture.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The rules leverage the path structure as a primary authorization mechanism. By nesting a user's orders within their own document path
 * (e.g., `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`), we can write a simple and performant rule (`isOwner(userId)`) without needing to perform extra reads (`get()`) on other documents.
 * Similarly, key relational IDs (like `userId` in an `Order` document) are validated to ensure they match the document's path, maintaining structural integrity.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Public data (`/products`) and private data (`/users`) are stored in separate top-level collections. This is a secure and performant pattern
 * that prevents accidental data leakage and simplifies queries, as a client can list items from `/products` without any risk of retrieving private user information.
